    "As I observed the discrete optimization approach to our problem and the grid of cells could have a large scale, then a good algorithm to get an optimal air defense systems deployment is genetic algorithm due to its heuristic nature, which gives an ability to work with complex problems with huge scale.\n",
    "As we could have a large number of cells, where we would deploy air defense systems, then a number of possible combinations is too huge.\n",

    "Now, let's take a basic look at the main idea of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Initial Population:* The process begins with a set of individuals, known as the population. Each individual represents a possible solution to the problem and is typically encoded as a string of characters, often binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fitness Function:* Each individual in the population is evaluated using a fitness function. This function determines how close an individual is to the optimal solution of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Selection:* Individuals are selected for reproduction based on their fitness. Those with higher fitness have a higher chance of being selected. This is akin to the natural selection process where stronger individuals have a better chance of surviving and reproducing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Crossover (Recombination):* Pairs of individuals are combined to form new offspring. This process involves swapping parts of their genetic information, which in the context of a GA, could mean swapping parts of their string representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mutation:* With a small probability, some parts of the offspring's genetic information are randomly altered. This introduces variability into the population and can help prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Replacement:* The new offspring are then added to the population, and some of the less fit individuals are removed. The population size usually remains constant from one generation to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Termination:* This process of selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement continues for many generations, or until maximum number of generations is met."
