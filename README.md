# Anti-Aircraft Defenses Optimal Placement
This is my final project of "Introduction to Data Science" course, the main goal of which is to solve optimization problem based on simulated data.

## Overview
I formulated the goal in terms of discrete optimization problem.

My solution is based on the Genetic Algorithm with proposed modification according to the problem features.

More information is inside the notebooks.

Main notebook is ```PPOLocationOptimization```.
